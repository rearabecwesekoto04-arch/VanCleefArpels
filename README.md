I restructured every page to align with the criteria of part 2 and morden web standards:

I added my 3 wireframes on my pdf as requested from the feedback I got form part 1.
Changed my root diractory to my business name which is Van Cleef & Arpels.
Move the logo from the center to the left.
Removed all deprecated tags <center>, <font>, inline styles and invalid HTML for example buttons wrapping links.
Migrated 100% of styling to a single external stylesheet (css_assets/style.css) using a pink-and-purple color scheme.
Restructured content with semantic HTML5 elements <header>, <nav>, <main>, <figure>, <address>.
Added descriptive alt text to all images and ensured proper heading hierarchy.
Implemented fully responsive layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox, with breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Applied interactive :hover and :focus states for accessibility and user experience.
Corrected typos, standardized pricing, and validated all pages for consistency and accessibility.
